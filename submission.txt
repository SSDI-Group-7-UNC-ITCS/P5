Project 8 - Submission Form group 7

1.

Story number and name: 4- Activity Feed
Story points: 4 
Brief description to see the story in action:
The introduction of the Activity Feed feature significantly enriches the user experience by offering a centralized view of recent activities on the photo-sharing site. Accessible through a dedicated "Activities" button on the topBar, this feed presents users with the five most recent activities.
Each activity entry in the feed includes essential details such as the date and time of the activity, the name of the user responsible, and the type of activity performed. For specific activities, additional information is provided, such as a small thumbnail of the uploaded photo or the comment author's name. 

2.
Story number and name: 6 - Photos Like Votes
Story points: 4 
Brief description to see the story in action:
The implementation of the "like" button for photos introduces a powerful mechanism for users to express their appreciation and acknowledgment of captivating content. Clicking the like button on a photo triggers a visual change, indicating the user's liking of the photo. To enhance user experience, the system also provides a visual indication if the user has already liked a particular photo.
The like count, displayed adjacent to the like button, dynamically updates in real-time, reflecting the collective appreciation of the community for each photo. The user's photo page is intelligently sorted based on the number of likes in descending order, with additional sorting by timestamp in reverse chronological order for photos with an equal number of likes.


3.
Story number and name: 5 - Deleting Comments, Users and Photos
Story points: 4 
Brief description to see the story in action:
Empowering users with the ability to delete their own content and account, the platform now supports the deletion of comments, photos, and entire user accounts. This feature adheres to a comprehensive approach, ensuring that users can only delete content they own.
When user or comment or photo is deleted, all associated details are permanently expunged from the database providing a thorough and secure deletion process.
